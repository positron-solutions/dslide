;;; Commentary:

;; Macro Slides is a highly programmable presentation framework that first
;; displays Org files as presentations but also can integrate your presentation
;; with any Emacs buffer and also with Org Babel.  By integrating arbitrary
;; Emacs Lisp into the simple forward-backward user interface, you can make
;; anything Emacs does easy to present.
;;
;; See the README and manual M-x info-display-manual RET macro-slides RET.
;;
;; There are examples of using the features within the test directory.
;;
;; Requirement:
;;    org-mode 9.6.x or higher version
;;    The latest version of the org-mode is recommended.
;;                      (see https://orgmode.org/)
;;
;; Usage:
;;    1. Open an org-mode file
;;    2. Run `ms-start'
;;
;; Note:
;;    - Customize variables, M-x customize-group RET macro-slides RET
;;
;; This package is a fork and mostly complete re-write of org-tree-slide by
;; Takaaki ISHIKAWA.  Thanks to everyone who worked on org-tree-slide over the
;; years.  The implementation ideas and features of org-tree-slide were a great
;; inspiration for this package.

;; step properly reports its maximum extent of progress, we can use forward and
